# Open in Claude Code

A simple Obsidian plugin that allows you to quickly open Claude Code in the current note's folder with a single click or keyboard shortcut.

## Features

- üöÄ **One-click access**: Open Claude Code directly from Obsidian's ribbon or command palette
- üìÅ **Smart folder detection**: Automatically uses the current note's folder as the working directory
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard shortcuts**: Configure your preferred keyboard shortcut
- üñ•Ô∏è **Terminal flexibility**: Choose from popular terminal apps or use a custom command
- üîç **Installation check**: Automatically detects if Claude Code is installed
- üíª **Desktop only**: Built specifically for desktop environments

## How it works

When you trigger the plugin (via ribbon icon, command palette, or keyboard shortcut), it:

1. Detects the folder of your currently active note
2. Opens your preferred terminal application
3. Navigates to that folder
4. Launches Claude Code

For example:
- If you're viewing `References/Brown butter nectarine tart.md`, Claude Code opens in the `References/` folder
- If you're viewing a note in the vault root, Claude Code opens in the vault root directory

## Installation

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Code not found

If the plugin reports that Claude Code is not found:

1. Make sure Claude Code is installed: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart
2. Verify it's accessible by running `claude` in your terminal
3. If installed in a non-standard location, update the Claude Code path in settings
